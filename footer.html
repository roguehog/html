                    Roguehog was inspired by witnessing endless incidents of dangerous driving as well as the accompanying stress and feeling of helplessness and frustration as the offenders sped away… the widespread adoption of dashcams presented a game changing opportunity to have eyes everywhere!
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    We crowdsource actual dashcam footage of traffic incidents and violations to provide auto insurers and other organizations with real world data reports on the driving behavior of their clients – and reward dashcam users for their uploads. A win-win situation.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Further bonuses include the prospect of safer roads – drivers thinking twice before acting recklessly, knowing one their fellow road users could record and report them – and cheaper and fairer insurance, through more accurate risk assessments and fewer accidents.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Motor vehicle crashes cost the US nearly $1 trillion per year. And the effects are pervasive with 28 percent property damage, 25 percent workplace productivity loss, 8 percent household productivity loss, 39 percent medical costs, traffic congestion, and other costs.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Roguehog – with your participation – can play an important role in changing the landscape of our roads. Join us!
